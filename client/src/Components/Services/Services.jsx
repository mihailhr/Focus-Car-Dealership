        <h3>3. Transport from the USA and Canada to Bulgaria</h3>
        <p>When you choose your vehicle (depending on where it is located), we will prepare an offer for transport—domestic (within the USA or Canada to the nearest port) and transoceanic—as well as transport from the port where the car will arrive to any point in Bulgaria. The approximate cost for transport from the USA or Canada to Bremerhaven (Germany) or Rotterdam (Netherlands) is between $1000 and $1300. The approximate cost for transport from Bremerhaven or Rotterdam to Bulgaria is between 1200 and 1400 BGN. Once the vehicle is loaded, photos are taken, which are uploaded to a real-time tracking system that you have access to, so you can monitor its location at any time until it arrives in Bulgaria. New photos are taken with each reloading and unloading to track its condition.</p>
        <h3>4. Unloading and Customs Clearance of Vehicles</h3>
        <p>We offer full assistance for unloading and customs clearance of your vehicle at your desired port, as well as the preparation of all necessary documents for its import to Bulgaria. With our specialized partners—renowned customs agencies with whom we have official partnerships—we ensure professional and reliable handling of the entire customs procedure.</p>
        <h3>5. Registration of Vehicles with the Traffic Police (KAT)</h3>
        <p>We prepare the complete set of documents necessary for the registration of your vehicle with KAT. Our professionals will assist you in gathering and preparing all required documents, including technical documentation, civil liability insurance, driving license, registration plates, and others.</p>
        <h3>6. Performing Technical Tests for Vehicles Imported from Outside the EU</h3>
        <p>Vehicles imported from outside Europe must undergo a technical test. We have an official partnership with technical test companies in Bulgaria and will arrange the technical test at a time and place of your choosing (personal parking or garage) without the need for you to drive your car to the technical test companies. This saves you time and money because your car will not have registration plates, and the only way to transport it will be by road assistance. The next step is to submit your documents to the Ministry of Transport, and after about a week, we will provide you with the finished document for the technical test, which will also give you the euro category of the vehicle. We will provide detailed information and an exact price after you select your vehicle.</p>

        <h1>We ensure that the customer remains satisfied.</h1>
        <p>In this regard, we will provide you with a real understanding of the prices for the car model you desire, as well as details regarding delivery costs. This will help you familiarize yourself with market prices and determine your budget according to the vehicle you are looking for. You can rely on our consultation regarding the suitable car based on your purpose. We will give you accurate prices from successful transactions involving similar vehicles to help you build a realistic view of the market. For example, if you plan to invest in a car for resale, we can recommend the most sought-after and quickly sold vehicles in Bulgaria. On the other hand, if you are looking for the perfect family car, we will provide you with information on vehicles that are easy to maintain and reliable for driving under Bulgarian conditions. <br />

Before making the purchase, we will conduct research on the vehicle you have chosen and check its documentation. If we find any discrepancies or issues with the documentation of the car you selected, we will refuse the sale, no matter how much you may want that particular vehicle. Our extensive knowledge ensures that you will not encounter problems later on.</p>
