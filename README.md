# Focus Car Dealership

## Project overview

Focus Car Dealership is a simple web application for importing cars and other vehicles from the USA and Canada. The application allows users to browse available vehicles, sort them by various criteria, and submit consultation forms for personalized assistance. The project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA), ensuring a smooth and fast user experience.

## Features
1. Entirely SPA
2. All vehicles are fetched from the remote database (MongoDB Atlas) before they are rendered.
3. Vehicles can be sorted based on various criteria (e.g. price, mileage, etc.).
4. The submission of the consultation form in the Contacts page automatically sends a personalized message to the given email.
5. When checking out a particular car, clicking on the share icon copies the car URL to the user's clipboard for easy sharing.
